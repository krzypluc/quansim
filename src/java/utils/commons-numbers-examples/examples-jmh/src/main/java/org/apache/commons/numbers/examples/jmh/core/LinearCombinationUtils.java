     *
     * <p>The condition number is defined as the inverse of the cosine of the angle between
     * the two vectors:
     *
     * <pre>
     * C = 1 / cos angle(x, y)
     *   = ||x'|| ||y|| / |x'*y|
     * </pre>
     * <p>where |x'*y| is the absolute of the dot product and ||.|| is the 2-norm (i.e. the
     * Euclidean length of each vector).
     *
     * <p>A high condition number means that small perturbations in the values result in
     * a large change in the final result. This occurs when the cosine of the angle approaches
     * 0 and the vectors are close to orthogonal.
     *
     * <p>Computation of the actual dot product requires an exact method to avoid cancellation
     * floating-point errors. BigDecimal is used to compute the exact result to the accuracy
     * defined by the {@link MathContext}. The dot product result is created in the range [-1, 1].
     * The actual condition number can be obtained by passing an array {@code computeC}. The
     * routine has been tested with anticipated condition numbers up to 1e300 to generate data
     * where the standard precision dot product will not overflow.
     *
     * <p>Uses the GenDot algorithm 6.1 from <a
     * href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.2.1547">
     * Accurate Sum and Dot Product</a> by Takeshi Ogita, Siegfried M. Rump, and
     * Shin'ichi Oishi published in <em>SIAM J. Sci. Comput</em>.
     *
     * <p>Note: Ogita et al state "in general the actual condition number is a
     * little larger than the anticipated one with quite some variation". This
     * implementation is computing a condition number approximately equal to the
     * requested for the parameters that have been tested.
