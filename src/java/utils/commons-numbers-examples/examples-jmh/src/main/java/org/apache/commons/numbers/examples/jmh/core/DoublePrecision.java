     *
     * The code below uses many additions/subtractions that may
     * appear redundant. However, they should NOT be simplified, as they
     * do use IEEE754 floating point arithmetic rounding properties.
     *
     * Algorithms are based on computing the product or sum of two values x and y in
     * extended precision. The standard result is stored using a double (high part z) and
     * the round-off error (or low part zz) is stored in a second double, e.g:
     * x * y = (z, zz); z + zz = x * y
     * x + y = (z, zz); z + zz = x + y
     *
     * To sum multiple (z, zz) results ideally the parts are sorted in order of
     * non-decreasing magnitude and summed. This is exact if each number's most significant
     * bit is below the least significant bit of the next (i.e. does not
     * overlap). Creating non-overlapping parts requires a rebalancing
     * of adjacent pairs using a summation z + zz = (z1, zz1) iteratively through the parts
     * (see Shewchuk (1997) Grow-Expansion and Expansion-Sum [1]).
